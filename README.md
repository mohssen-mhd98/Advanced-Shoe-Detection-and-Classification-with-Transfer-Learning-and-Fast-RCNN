# Advanced-Shoe-Detection-and-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning-and-Fast-RCNN
Developed several models to classify different types of shoes in a shoe image dataset. The dataset was preprocessed using a Fast-RCNN model for image detection, specifically for shoe detection, and data augmentation techniques were applied to mitigate overfitting and address the significant gap between training and validation accuracy seen in existing models. The classification accuracy of the CNN model improved substantially by leveraging transfer learning with EfficientNet and ResNet architectures, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Finally, a test set gathered by downloading images around the web to test models. the accuracy for EfficientNet and ResNet were 96 and 82 percent respectively.
Moreover, a brief report about the project developing steps is available with the "A Foot in the Door" file in Farsi :)
